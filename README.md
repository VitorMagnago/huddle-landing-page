## My process

The layouts in figma had the size of 1440x800 (desktop version) and 375x800 in the mobile version. I made the page based on these sizes, but the result on screens between these two sizes was not so good, with several parts breaking all over the page, I couldn't make the elements fluid enough to avoid this.

The background image took a lot of work, small changes in the screen size already made it break, even using the `background-size` property.

A "solution" I did was to put an intermediate breakpoint to solve this problem a little.

Some feedback would be great to make my layout more fluid between breakpoints.
